Interests Include 
- My Dog! 
- Professionally, I am very interested in maximizing the useability of data across my organization. 
- On my off time, I am researching to learn more about data meshes over data lakes and their uses in a work environment. 

## Technical Background

I have spent the majority of my professional career in scripting languages like SQL. In SQL I have built complex data sources that interweave different databases and servers alike. 

However, I am always look for opportunity to improve, so I have expanded my knowledge of programming to be able to effectively write programs in Java and Python. I have also completed several projects in C, C++, and R. 

Moving forward, I would like to find new and creative ways to use Python to bring interactive visualizations to my team and allow them to work collaboratively to solve business issues.
